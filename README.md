## **Docker Container Management & Nmap Scanning**
**Automated VPN & Security Analysis Tool**

### **Purpose**
This Python script automates the management of Docker containers for VPN testing and network analysis using Nmap. It integrates advanced logging and messaging with Telegram for real-time updates, enabling efficient monitoring and scanning.

---

### **Key Features**

1. **Docker Container Management**
   - Start, stop, and manage containers programmatically.
   - Dynamically configure containers with specific network settings.

2. **Network Interface Detection**
   - Automatically identifies network interfaces (`ppp0`).
   - Retrieves CIDRs and configures routing tables within containers.

3. **Nmap Scanning Integration**
   - Installs `nmap` and additional tools inside containers.
   - Performs network vulnerability scans for specific ports and services (e.g., SMB, RDP).
   - Outputs results in structured formats like JSON and XML.

4. **Telegram Notifications**
   - Sends real-time updates and scan summaries to specified Telegram chats.
   - Shares files (e.g., Nmap results) via Telegram for easy accessibility.

5. **Error Handling & Logging**
   - Implements retry mechanisms for container operations and CIDR retrieval.
   - Logs actions and errors with timestamped entries for debugging.

### **Workflow Overview**

1. **Container Initialization**
   - Defines container properties such as IP, VPN credentials, and privileged permissions.
   - Starts and configures Docker containers with these properties.

2. **Interface & CIDR Management**
   - Checks for the existence of network interfaces within the container.
   - Retrieves and validates CIDRs for further scanning.

3. **Nmap Installation & Scanning**
   - Installs tools (`nmap`, `jq`) to facilitate network scanning and result processing.
   - Executes scans using advanced Nmap arguments for service detection and vulnerability analysis.

4. **Results Processing**
   - Parses Nmap XML output into JSON for easier interpretation.
   - Filters and sends relevant results to Telegram.
   - Saves detailed results as JSON files for future reference.

### **Telegram Interaction**

- **Real-time Updates:**
  - Notifies on key milestones (e.g., container start, scan completion).
  - Alerts on errors or invalid configurations.

- **Detailed Reporting:**
  - Sends formatted scan summaries and full scan results.
  - Shares JSON files containing detailed scan data.

### **System Requirements**

1. **Dependencies**
   - Python Modules: `requests`, `time`, `subprocess`, `logging`, `xmltodict`, `json`
   - Linux tools within Docker containers: `nmap`, `jq`

2. **Docker Networking**
   - Privileged access for configuring custom routes and VPN addresses.

3. **Telegram API Integration**
   - A valid Telegram bot API key and chat IDs for notifications.

---

### **Potential Use Cases**
- Automated VPN testing and validation.
- Network vulnerability assessments.
- Real-time security monitoring for dynamic IP ranges.
- Scalable testing for large-scale networks.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Expand Features:**
   - Add support for custom Nmap scripts.
   - Enhance error reporting with container-specific logs.

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Parallelize scanning across containers for faster execution.

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) using environment variables or encrypted files.

4. **Testing Automation:**
   - Develop unit tests to validate individual components.
